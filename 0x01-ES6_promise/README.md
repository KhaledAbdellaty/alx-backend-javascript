# JavaScript Promise: An Introduction
## Promises in JavaScript
Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript, introduced in ES6, that allow you to work with asynchronous operations in a more synchronous-like manner. They help in managing callbacks and provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly.

## Async and Await
Async Functions
Async functions in JavaScript provide a more readable and concise way to work with asynchronous code. They allow you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, avoiding callback hell and making code easier to understand.

## Await Operator
The await operator can only be used inside async functions. It allows you to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is settled (resolved or rejected), and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. This makes it easier to write asynchronous code that reads more like synchronous code.

## Throw / Try
Error Handling with Promises
Error handling in Promises can be done using .catch() method or try...catch block inside an async function.
